Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" project (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
Using the data provided by this project (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) we have created two data sets
 - A data set with the Mean and StandardDeviation of the test and train observations, with the subject and activity: observations.txt
 - A data set with the Mean of the values in the first dataset aggregated per Activity and Subject: perSubjectActivityMean.txt
 
'AxisXYZ' is used to denote 3Axisaxial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	BodyAccelerationAxisXYZ
	GravityAccelerationAxisXYZ
	BodyAccelerationJerkAxisXYZ
	BodyGyroAxisXYZ
	BodyGyroJerkAxisXYZ
	BodyAccelerationMag
	GravityAccelerationMag
	BodyAccelerationJerkMag
	BodyGyroMag
	BodyGyroJerkMag
	BodyAccelerationAxisXYZ
	BodyAccelerationJerkAxisXYZ
	BodyGyroAxisXYZ
	BodyAccelerationMag
	BodyAccelerationJerkMag
	BodyGyroMag
	BodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean: Mean value
StandardDeviation: Standard deviation

The Activity codes are:
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
